title: Clownfish

---

The clownfish is a hermaphrodite; a clownfish that is born male has the capability to change into a female! This happens when the dominant female in a group of clownfish dies. The dominant male becomes a female and will mate with another male in the group. Once the fish has undergone the change, it cannot be reversed back.
