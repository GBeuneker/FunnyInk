           <p>I'm Judith van der Stouw, a Netherlands based illustrator. My inspiration comes from the stranger inhabitants of the animal kingdom! I bring these animals to light by immortalizing them in ink. I sell these illustrations on postcards and other products, and they also feature in my columns in Gay News magazine. I also do other projects such as creating logo's, and I am currently part of a children's book project for which I am creating the illustrations.</p>
