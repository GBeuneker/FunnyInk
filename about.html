           <p>I'm Judith van der Stouw, a Netherlands based illustrator. My inspiration comes from the stranger inhabitants of the animal kingdom! I bring these animals to light by immortalizing them in ink. I sell these illustrations on postcards and other products, and they also feature in a column in Gay News magazine. I am also part of a children's book project for which I create the illustrations.</p>
